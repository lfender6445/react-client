1.4.2 (June XXX, 2022)
 - Bugfixing - Fixed issue with useTreatments hooks, to return control treatments without evaluating splits when the SDK client is not ready or is destroyed, to avoid not ready impressions and warning log.

      - Added `scheduler.telemetryRefreshRate` property to SDK configuration, and deprecated `scheduler.metricsRefreshRate` property.
      - Updated SDK telemetry storage, metrics and updater to be more effective and send less often.
      - Updated eventsource dependecy range to ^1.1.2 to avoid dependency resolution to a vulnerable version of this package as much as possible when combined with other dependencies.

      - Added `scheduler.impressionsQueueSize` property to SDK configuration to limit the amount of impressions tracked in memory. Read more in our docs.
      - Added support to SDK clients on browser to optionally bind attributes to the client, keeping these loaded within the SDK along with the user ID, for easier usage when requesting flag.
      - Updated format for MySegments keys in LocalStorage, keeping backwards compatibility (issue https://github.com/splitio/javascript-client/issues/638).

1.2.3 (February 8, 2021)
 - Updated React peer dependency range to include React@17.x.x.
 - Added `memoize-one` dependency for basic memoization utilities.
 - Bugfixing - Optimizing splits evaluation via memoization in order to remove `shouldComponentUpdate` method of `SplitTreatments` component and avoid stopping render propagation (issue #42).

 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio dependency to version 10.15.2.
 - Updated internal validation to avoid errors when passing an invalid list of split names to `SplitTreatments` component and `useTreatments` hook.
 - Updated node-fetch and init dev dependencies for vulnerability fixes

1.2.1 (Oct 7, 2020)
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio dependency to version 10.15.0, which uses the optimized impressions sending and supports filtering the splits to be synced. Learn more in our javascript-client changelog or documentation.
 - Updated some NPM dependencies mostly for vulnerability fixes.

1.2.0 (July 23, 2020)
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio dependency to version 10.13.0, which uses streaming synchronization by default, amongst other updates. Learn more in our javascript-client changelog or documentation.
 - Updated `shouldComponentUpdate` method of `SplitTreatments` component for optimization: it only updates if the treatment evaluation changes.
 - Updated build configuration to exclude React library from UMD bundle.
 - Added missing status properties of Split clients into SplitContext: `isReadyFromCache`, `hasTimedout`, and `isDestroyed`. They are passed down as props when using functions as a child of both SplitFactory, SplitClient and SplitTreatments components.
 - Added an optional prop to `SplitFactory` and `SplitClient`: `updateOnSdkReadyFromCache`, to update the component when an SDK_READY_FROM_CACHE event is emitted. Its value is true by default.
